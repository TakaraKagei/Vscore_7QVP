# Vscore_7QVP
This is the source code to calculate Vscore in 7qvp.cif.



                                           !!!Caution!!!
This source code is specifically optimized to calculate the V-score for the structure provided in
**7qvp.cif** using my local machine.
The operations—including file loading, chain ID and atomic coordinates extraction—are **hardcoded**
and therefore not generalized for any other PDB file.
